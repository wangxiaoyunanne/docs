Computational patterns in GraphSAGE related to Gunrock: 
(1) neighborhood sample 
(2) aggregate neighbor nodes attributes. 
Gunrock has function to access the degree of nodes and nodes neighborhood;
Basic reduce algorithm could be used for aggregations.
Neighborhood sample is the key to many GNNs accelerating methods,
it could be the bottleneck for node with large degrees,
thus our Gunrock could contribute a lot in GNNs accelerations. 


Other computations needs:
(1)	Matrix multiplication in forward and backward propagations. 
(2)	Softmax() function
Gunrock does not support automatic backpropagations,
so we need to calculate the gradients formula by hand for backpropagation,
then use matrix-matrix multiplications to get each layerâ€™s gradients;
